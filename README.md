Visibility of Point Cloud
--------------------------

This project investigates and implements the Hidden Point Removal operator described
in Katz et. al. "Direct Visibility of Point Sets", 2007.

A copy of the "Direct Visibility of Point Sets" is in the top level directory of this project.

The source code implemented is available in the `HPR-PCL-QT` directory.
The program can read point clouds in PCD and PLY files.
Refer to the `README.md` in `HPR-PCL-QT` for more information on how to run the program.

The final report can be found in the report directory.

The data directory has some of the data used in this project.
